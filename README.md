2-D Data Plotting in Lisp

### What's Been Done

This is a fork of [David McClain's][dbmcclain] [LispPlotter][plotter]
code. There were 2 goals to this fork. (1) Get aquainted with the code
base and (2) factor out all of the dependencies. That's what's been
done. All of the Mac glue code has been removed. The only thing left
is CL. This may be a step too far, but I didn't want to bother testing
this on a Mac.
